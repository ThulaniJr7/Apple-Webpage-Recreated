# Apple-Webpage-Recreated

I created the Apple South Africa website for a final module project. 
The Web-page incorporates all the features that were present at the time of creation of the Web-page.

The Web-page has CSS stylying suitable for LAPTOP viewing ONLY. 
We had to make it from scratch and make it look as close as possible to the website.
I did not make any media query adjustments for smaller devices such as Tablets and Phones.
The page has links, images and icons that will allow the user to go to the main Apple Website and use their features.
